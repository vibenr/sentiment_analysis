## Sentiment Analysis using Python
- This project is built to learn data analysis using Python. 
- Dataset: Amazon Reveiews 
- Aim: Sentiment Analysis
- I have used VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sentiment Reasoner) a popular sentiment analysis model specifically designed for analyzing sentiment in social media texts. It is available in the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library, which is commonly used for natural language processing tasks in Python.
